----------

This is a simple benchmark for python async frameworks. Almost all of the
frameworks are ASGI-compatible (aiohttp and tornado are exceptions on the
moment).

The objective of the benchmark is not testing deployment (like uvicorn vs
hypercorn and etc) or database (ORM, drivers) but instead test the frameworks
itself. The benchmark checks request parsing (body, headers, formdata,
queries), routing, responses.

## The Methodic

The benchmark runs as a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions).
According to the [github
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)
the hardware specification for the runs is:

* 2-core vCPU (Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), Intel速 Xeon速 8171M 2.1GHz (Skylake))
* 7 GB of RAM memory
* 14 GB of SSD disk space
* OS Ubuntu 20.04

[ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) apps are running from docker using the gunicorn/uvicorn command:

    gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b 0.0.0.0:8080 app:app

Applications' source code can be found
[here](https://github.com/klen/py-frameworks-bench/tree/develop/frameworks).

Results received with WRK utility using the params:

    wrk -d15s -t4 -c64 [URL]

The benchmark has a three kind of tests:

1. "Simple" test: accept a request and return HTML response with custom dynamic
   header. The test simulates just a single HTML response.

2. "API" test: Check headers, parse path params, query string, JSON body and return a json
   response. The test simulates an JSON REST API.

3. "Upload" test: accept an uploaded file and store it on disk. The test
   simulates multipart formdata processing and work with files.
